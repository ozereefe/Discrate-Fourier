# Discrete Fourier Transform in MATLAB

This project demonstrates the derivation and application of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in MATLAB using a manually defined algorithm.

## Function Used
The signal is defined as:  
`f(x) = 3 cos(10πx) + 2 sin(5πx) + cos(20πx)`

## What this code does
- Samples the function at a defined sampling rate
- Calculates the DFT manually (not using `fft`)
- Extracts amplitude and phase information
- Reconstructs the signal using these parameters
- Plots the original and reconstructed signals for comparison

## Requirements
- MATLAB (No toolboxes required)

## License
MIT License
